# Guessing Game: Treehouse Techdegree Project 1

## Why this project exists
This project is designed to demonstrate and practice the skills learned in Unit 1 of the Python for Web Development Techdegree program with Treehouse.

## What it does
This script implements a simple guessing game. It picks a random number from 1-10, then prompts the user to guess what it is.

The user attempts to guess the number until they get it right, at which point the script tells them they got it, and how many attempts it took them to get it. If desired, the user can play again and try for a higher score.

## How to run it
Save the file guessing_game.py to your machine, and run it in Python 3.6 or higher. In macOS, for example, do:
`python ~/Documents/PythonPrograms/guessing_game.py`

Then simply follow the on-screen prompts and instructions.
Lower versions of Python may also work, but have not been tested extensively.
